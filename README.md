# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game ✔️❌


Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic, simple strategy game for two players. It is typically played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a space in the grid with their symbols: one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". 

## Game Setup

### Grid: 
A 3x3 square grid is drawn, totaling nine cells.

### Symbols: 
One player is assigned the symbol "X", and the other is assigned "O".

## How to Play

1: Starting the Game: Decide randomly who goes first.
2: Turns: Players alternate turns, starting with the chosen first player.
3: Placing Symbols: On their turn, each player places their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid.
4: Winning the Game: The first player to align three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5: Draw: If all nine cells are filled and no player has formed a line of three symbols, the game ends in a draw.
